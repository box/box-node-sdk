This release contains a number of changes. The most notable are:
- Drop support for Node versions below 12.
- Bump `jsonwebtoken` to version 9.0.0.

## Runtime requirements

From this version, we will only support Node versions 12 and above. This is due to the fact that `jsonwebtoken` version 9.0.0 dropped support for Node versions below 12. If you are using an older version of Node, you will need to upgrade to a newer version.

## Dependencies

### `jsonwebtoken`

We have bumped the version of `jsonwebtoken` to 9.0.0 to fix a security vulnerability. If you are using `jsonwebtoken` directly, you will need to upgrade to version 9.0.0 to avoid conflicts.
