This release contains a number of changes. The most notable are:

- Drop support for Node versions below 12.
- Bump `jsonwebtoken` to version 9.0.0.

## Runtime requirements

From this version, we will only support Node versions 12 and above. This is due to the fact that `jsonwebtoken` version 9.0.0 dropped support for Node versions below 12. If you are using an older version of Node, you will need to upgrade to a newer version.

## Dependencies

### `jsonwebtoken`

We have bumped the version of `jsonwebtoken` to 9.0.0 to fix a security vulnerability. If you are using `jsonwebtoken` directly, you will need to upgrade to version 9.0.0 to avoid conflicts.

## Removed deprecated methods and classes

### `CollaborationWhitelist`

The deprecated `CollaborationWhitelist` class has been removed. If you are using this class, you will need to use the [`CollaborationAllowlist`][collaboration-allow-list] class instead.

### [`CollaborationAllowlist`][collaboration-allow-list]

Method `CollaborationAllowlist.getWhitelistedDomain()` has been removed. If you are using this method, you will need to use [`CollaborationAllowlist.getAllowlistedDomain()`][get-allowlisted-domains] instead.

Method `CollaborationAllowlist.getAllWhitelistedDomains()` has been removed. If you are using this method, you will need to use [`CollaborationAllowlist.getAllAllowlistedDomains()`][get-all-allowlisted-domains] instead.

### `Files`

Method `Files.getThumbnail( fileID: string, options?: Record<string, any>, callback?: Function )` has been removed. If you are using this method, you will need to use [`Files.getRepresentationContent( fileID, representationType, options, callback)`][get-rep-content] instead.

With this method, you can generate a representation of a file. A representation is an alternative asset for a file stored in Box. These assets can be PDFs, thumbnails, or text extractions.

Representations are automatically generated for the supported file types, either when uploading to Box or when requesting the asset.

#### Example

To get the thumbnail for a file has the extension in this list of [supported file types][representations-thumbnail-file-type], you can use the following code:

 ```js
const thumbnail = await client.files.getRepresentationContent('123', 'thumbnail');
thumbnail.pipe(fs.createWriteStream('thumbnail.png'));
```

For others file types, you can get the list of representations available for a file using the [`Files.getRepresentationInfo()`][get-rep-info] method, then use the [`Files.getRepresentationContent()`][get-rep-content] method to get the content of the representation.

```js
const representations = await client.files.getRepresentationInfo(fileId);
const representation = representations.entries.find((entry) => entry.representation === 'png');
if (!representation) {
    console.log('No png representation');
    return;
}
const png = await client.files.getRepresentationContent(fileId, `[${representation.representation}?dimensions=${representation.properties.dimensions}]`);
png.pipe(fs.createWriteStream('file.png'));
```
