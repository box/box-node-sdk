Get Terms of Service for an Enterprise
--------------------------------------

To get terms of service call the [`termsOfService.getAll(options, callback)`](http://opensource.box.com/box-node-sdk/jsdoc/TermsOfService.html#getAll)
method.

```js
client.termsOfService.getAll(null, callback);
```
Alternatively, you can specify the Terms of Service type. You can either specify "managed" or "external". This
field specifies the type of user the Terms of Service applies to. 

```js
client.termsOfService.getAll({ tos_type: 'managed' }, callback);
```

Get a Terms of Service By ID for an Enterprise
----------------------------------------------

To get the terms of service with an ID call the [`termsOfService.get(termsOfServicesID, options, callback)`](http://opensource.box.com/box-node-sdk/jsdoc/TermsOfService.html#get)
method.

```js
client.termsOfService.get('1234', null, callback);
```

Requesting information for only the fields you need with the `fields` option
can improve performance and reduce the size of the network request.

Update a Terms of Service for an Enterprise
-------------------------------------------

To update a terms of service call the [`termsOfService.update(termsOfServicesID, updates, callback)`](http://opensource.box.com/box-node-sdk/jsdoc/TermsOfService.html#update)
method with the fields to update and their new values.

```js
client.termsOfService.update('1234', 
	{
		status: 'enabled',
		text: 'This is a test'
	}, 
	callback);
```

The termsOfServicesStatus can be set to 'enabled' or 'disabled'. You can also specify the conditions of the terms of service in the termsOfServicesText parameter. 

Create a Terms of Service for an Enterprise
-------------------------------------------

To create a terms of service call the [`termsOfService.create(termsOfServicesType, termsOfServicesStatus, termsOfServicesText, callback)`](http://opensource.box.com/box-node-sdk/jsdoc/TermsOfService.html#create)
method.

```js
client.termsOfService.create('managed', 'enabled', 'This is a new terms of service', callback);
```

```js
client.termsOfService.create('external', 'disabled', 'This is a new terms of service but disabled', callback);
```

It is important to note that only two terms of service can exist per enterprise. One managed terms of service and one external terms of service. If you wish to make another terms of service please use the PUT endpoint to update your current terms of service. 

Get Terms of Service Status for User
------------------------------------

To get user status on a terms of service call the [`termsOfService.getUserStatus(termsOfStatusID, options, callback)`](http://opensource.box.com/box-node-sdk/jsdoc/TermsOfServiceUserStatuses.html#getUserStatus)
method.

```js
client.termsOfService.getUserStatus('1234',
	{
		user_id: '5678'
	},
	callback);
```

If no user is specified, this will default to current user.

Create User Status on Terms of Service 
--------------------------------------

To accept or decline a terms of service for a user who has never accepted/decline this terms of service before call the [`termsOfService.createUserStatus(termsOfServicesID, isAccepted, options, callback)`](http://opensource.box.com/box-node-sdk/jsdoc/TermsOfService.html#createUserStatus)
method.

```js
client.termsOfService.createUserStatus('1234', true, {user_id: "5678"}, callback);
```
It is important to note that this will accept or decline a custom terms of service for a user that has 
never taken action on this terms of service before. For a user that has, this will return a 409 Conflict Error.

If no user is specified, this will default to current user.

Update User Status on Terms of Service 
--------------------------------------

To update user status on a terms of service call the [`termsOfService.updateUserStatus(termsOfServiceUserStatusID, isAccepted, callback)`](http://opensource.box.com/box-node-sdk/jsdoc/TermsOfService.html#updateUserStatus)
method.

```js
client.termsOfService.updateUserStatus('5678', true, callback);
```

It is important to note that this will accept or decline a custom terms of service for a user. For a user that has taken action in this terms of service, this will update their status. If the user has never taken action on this terms of service then this will return a 404 Not Found Error. 

Accept or Decline a Terms of Service
------------------------------------

To create user/terms of service association and accept/decline call the [`termsOfService.setUserStatus(termsOfServicesID, isAccepted, options, callback)`](http://opensource.box.com/box-node-sdk/jsdoc/TermsOfService.html#setUserStatus))
method.
