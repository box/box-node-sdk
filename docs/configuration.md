# Configuration

The `BoxSDKNode` is the base object used to configure [client](./client.md).

## Configure how client retries calls and handles timeouts

You can confugure how many retries, how long to wait between retries or upload timeout:

```javascript
sdk = BoxSDKNode.getPreconfiguredInstance(APP_SETTINGS);
var additonalParams = {
	numMaxRetries: 3,
	retryIntervalMS: 3000,
	uploadRequestTimeoutMS: 90000
};
sdk.configure(additonalParams);
```

The `numMaxRetries` sets the maximum  number of retries when API request fails. Default value is `5`.

The `retryIntervalMS` is used to calculate the wait time between retries. It is a number of miliseconds. SDK uses `Exponential backoff` algorithm 
to calculate the wait time. Default value is `2000` ms.

The `uploadRequestTimeoutMS` sets the timeout after which an upload request is aborted Default value is `60000` ms.

The `configure` method appends config values to existing configuration. So if you want you can configure sdk in several steps:

```javascript
sdk = BoxSDKNode.getPreconfiguredInstance(APP_SETTINGS);
sdk.configure({
	retryIntervalMS: 3000
});

// you need to extend number of retires in some scenario
sdk.configure({
    numMaxRetries: 10
});
```

## Configure Base URL

The Base Url is the URL that is used by the SDK to access Box. The default base URL are already defined
for the `BoxSDKNode` but if you want to change default behaviour use the `configure` method on
the sdk instance:

```javascript
sdk = BoxSDKNode.getPreconfiguredInstance(APP_SETTINGS);
var additonalParams = {
	apiRootURL: 'https://my.company.url.com',
	uploadAPIRootURL: 'https://my.company.url.com/upload',
	authorizeRootURL: 'https://my.company.url.com/authorize'
};
sdk.configure(additonalParams);
```

The `apiRootURL` sets to what URL all API calls will be directed.
Final URL used to access Box is built using `apiRootURL` and the API Version (`2.0`). For example by default the `apiRootURL`
is set to `https://api.box.com` so after appending currently supported API version the URL is : `https://api.box.com/2.0`.

The `uploadAPIRootURL` is used to configure the base URL used while uploading files.
Final URL used to access Box is built using `uploadAPIRootURL` and API Version (`2.0`). For example by default the `uploadAPIRootURL`
is set to `https://upload.box.com/api` so after appending currently supported API version the URL is : `https://upload.box.com/api/2.0`.

The `authorizeRootURL` is used to configure the base URL used to obtain OAuth2 authorization tokens.
