Storage Policies
================

Storage policies allow enterprise administrators to choose where their content is physically stored;
different policies can be purchased and assigned either as the default policy for the entire enterprise
or on a per-user basis.

Get Available Storage Policies for an Enterprise
------------------------------------------------

To get a list of the storage policies that are available for the current user's enterprise,
call the [`storagePolicies.getAll(options, callback)`][getAll] method.

```js
client.storagePolicies.getAll()
    .then(policies => {
        /* policies -> {
            next_marker: null,
            limit: 1000,
            entries: 
            [ { type: 'storage_policy', id: '42', name: 'Montreal / Dublin' },
                { type: 'storage_policy', id: '126', name: 'Frankfurt / Dublin' },
                { type: 'storage_policy', id: '162', name: 'US' } ] }
        */
    });
```

Get Information About a Specific Storage Policy
-----------------------------------------------

Information about a specific storage policy (by its ID) can be retrieved by calling
the [`storagePolicies.get(storagePolicyID, options, callback)`][get] method with the
ID of the assignment object.

```js
client.storagePolicies.get('6')
    .then(storagePolicy => {
        /* storagePolicy -> {
            type: 'storage_policy', 
            id: '6',
            name: 'Tokyo & Singapore' }
        */
    });
```

Assign a Storage Policy to a User
---------------------------------

To assign a storage policy to a user, call the [`storagePolicies.assign(storagePolicyID, userID, callback)`][assign]
method with the ID of the storage policy to assign and the ID of the user to which it should be assigned.

> __Note:__ This method will check if an assignment already exists for the user and take appropriate action.
> It should work regardless of the current status of the user.

```js
var storagePolicyID = '7';
var userID = '22222';
client.storagePolicies.assign(storagePolicyID, userID)
    .then(assignment => {
        /* assignment -> {
            type: 'storage_policy_assignment',
            id: 'dXNlcl8yMjIyMg==',
            storage_policy: 'storage_policy', id: '7' },
            assigned_to: { type: 'user', id: '22222' } }
        */
    });
```

Get Information About a Specific Storage Policy Assignment
----------------------------------------------------------

To get information about a specific storage policy assignment by ID, call the
[`storagePolicies.getAssignment(asisgnmentID, callback)`][getAssignment] method
with the ID of the storage policy assignment.

```js
client.storagePolicies.getAssignment('dXNlcl8yMjIyMg==')
    .then(assignment => {
        /* assignment -> {
            type: 'storage_policy_assignment',
            id: 'dXNlcl8yMjIyMg==',
            storage_policy: 'storage_policy', id: '7' },
            assigned_to: { type: 'user', id: '22222' } }
        */
    });
```

Get the Storage Policy Assigned to a User
-----------------------------------------

To determine which storage policy is assigned to a user, call
[`storagePolicies.getAssignmentForTarget(userID, callback)`][getAssignmentForTarget]
with the ID of the user.

```js
client.storagePolicies.getAssignmentForTarget('22222')
    .then(assignment => {
        /* assignment -> {
            type: 'storage_policy_assignment',
            id: 'dXNlcl8yMjIyMg==',
            storage_policy: 'storage_policy', id: '7' },
            assigned_to: { type: 'user', id: '22222' } }
        */
    });
```

Create a Storage Policy Assignment
----------------------------------

To create a new storage policy assignment, call the
[`storagePolicies.createAssignment(policyID, userID, callback)`][create-assignment] method
with the ID of the storage policy to assign and the ID of the user to assign it to.

> __Note:__ This method only works if the user does not already have an assignment.
> If the current state of the user is not known, use the [`storagePolicies.assign()`](#assign-a-storage-policy-to-a-user)
> method instead.

```js
client.storagePolicies.createAssignment('7', '22222')
    .then(assignment => {
        /* assignment -> {
            type: 'storage_policy_assignment',
            id: 'dXNlcl8yMjIyMg==',
            storage_policy: 'storage_policy', id: '7' },
            assigned_to: { type: 'user', id: '22222' } }
        */
    });
```

Update a Storage Policy Assignment
----------------------------------

To update a storage policy assignment, for example to update which storage policy is
asisgned to a user, call the [`storagePolicies.updateAssignment(assignmentID, updates, callback)`][updateAssignment]
method with the ID of the assignment to update and an object containing key/value mapping of fields
to update on the assignment.

```js
// Reassign user 22222 to storage policy 10
var assignmentID = 'dXNlcl8yMjIyMg==';
var updates = {
    storage_policy: {
        type: 'storage_policy',
        id: '10'
    }
};

client.storagePolicies.updateAssignment(assignmentID, updates)
    .then(updatedAssignment => {
        /* updatedAssignment -> {
            type: 'storage_policy_assignment',
            id: 'dXNlcl8yMjIyMg==',
            storage_policy: 'storage_policy', id: '10' },
            assigned_to: { type: 'user', id: '22222' } }
        */
    });
```

Remove a Storage Policy Assignment
----------------------------------

To remove a storage policy assignment and return the user it was assigned to to the
default storage policy for the enterprise, call
[`storagePolicies.removeAssignment(assignmentID, callback)`][removeAssignment] with
the ID of the assignment to remove.

```js
client.storagePolicies.removeAssignment('dXNlcl8yMjIyMg==')
    .then(() => {
        // deletion succeeded â€” no value returned
    });
```
