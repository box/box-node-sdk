## Installation
Node SDK Installation [details](https://developer.box.com/guides/tooling/sdks/node/).

```
npm install --save box-node-sdk
```

## Getting Started


To get started with the SDK, get a Developer Token from the Configuration page
of your app in the [Box Developer Console][dev-console].
You can use this token to make test calls for your own Box account.

```js
var BoxSDK = require('box-node-sdk');

// Initialize the SDK with your app credentials
var sdk = new BoxSDK({
  clientID: 'CLIENT_ID',
  clientSecret: 'CLIENT_SECRET'
});

// Create a basic API client, which does not automatically refresh the access token
var client = sdk.getBasicClient('DEVELOPER_TOKEN');

// Get your own user object from the Box API
// All client methods return a promise that resolves to the results of the API call,
// or rejects when an error occurs
client.users.get(client.CURRENT_USER_ID)
	.then(user => console.log('Hello', user.name, '!'))
	.catch(err => console.log('Got an error!', err));
```

[dev-console]: https://app.box.com/developers/console

## Creating API Clients


Clients are used to communicate with the API on behalf of a user.

Box supports three different types of client:

- **Basic Client:** Simple, makes calls via the given access token until the access token expires
- **Persistent Client:** For use with traditional OAuth2 apps, can refresh its tokens automatically and persist them via a token store
- **App Auth Client:** Uses the app auth JWT grant to act on behalf of app/managed users and create new tokens automatically

### Basic Client

Returns a Box Client with a Basic API Session. The client is able to make requests on behalf of a user. A basic session has no access to a user's refresh token. Because of this, once the session's tokens expire the client cannot recover and a new session will need to be generated.

```js
var client = BoxSDK.getBasicClient('ACCESS_TOKEN');
```

### Persistent Client

Returns a Box Client with a persistent API session. A persistent API session helps manage the user's tokens, and can refresh them automatically if the access token expires. If a central data-store is given, the session can read & write tokens to it.

> NOTE: If tokenInfo or tokenStore are formatted incorrectly, this method will throw an error. If you haven't explicitly created either of these objects or are otherwise not completely confident in their validity, you should wrap your call to getPersistentClient in a try-catch to handle any potential errors.

If you do not provide a token store object, the SDK will continue refreshing tokens locally as long
as the Node.js process lives, but will not able to restore the user's authentication on process
restart or share that authentication state between different processes.
```js
var client = sdk.getPersistentClient(tokenInfo, null);
```

Providing a token store will allow the SDK to persist the user's authentication state
so that you can resume making API calls as a user if the Node.js process needs to restart,
or share the authentication state between multiple different processes.
```js
var client = sdk.getPersistentClient(tokenInfo, tokenStore);
```

The token store is the interface used by persistent clients to interact with the consumer app's central storage layer. For a token store to be valid, it must have the following three methods:

```js
store.read(function(err, data) {}); // read TokenInfo from app central store.
store.write(tokenInfo, function(err, data) {}); // write TokenInfo to the app's central store.
store.clear(function(err, data) {}); // delete TokenInfo from the app's central store.
```

Note that these methods don't pass in identifying information as arguments. You'll most likely need to create them on-demand for each client.

### App Auth Client

App Auth allows an app to fully manage the Box accounts of its users; they do not
have direct login credentials to Box and all operations are performed through the API
using a JWT grant.

If you have a JSON configuration file from the [Box Developer Console][dev-console]
that includes your private key information, you can import that directly to create an SDK instance:

```js
var sdkConfig = require('/path/to/config.json');
var sdk = BoxSDK.getPreconfiguredInstance(sdkConfig);

// Get the service account client, used to create and manage app user accounts
// The enterprise ID is pre-populated by the JSON configuration,
// so you don't need to specify it here
var serviceAccountClient = sdk.getAppAuthClient('enterprise');

// Get an app user or managed user client
var appUserClient = sdk.getAppAuthClient('user', 'YOUR-APP-USER-ID');
```

Otherwise, you can manually pass the necessary configuration parameters to the SDK:

```js
var sdk = new BoxSDK({
	clientID: 'CLIENT_ID',
	clientSecret: 'CLIENT_SECRET',
	appAuth: {
		keyID: 'PUBLIC_KEY_ID',
		privateKey: 'PRIVATE_KEY',
		passphrase: 'PRIVATE_KEY_PASSPHRASE'
	}
});

// Get the service account client, used to create and manage app user accounts
var serviceAccountClient = sdk.getAppAuthClient('enterprise', 'APP_ENTERPRISE_ID');

// Get an app user or managed user client
var appUserClient = sdk.getAppAuthClient('user', 'YOUR-APP-USER-ID');
```


## Using the Client to Make API Calls


The different API endpoints you can call are represented as methods, grouped into
managers by the type of object they interact with.

For example:
```js
// Get the user object for the current user
client.users.get(client.CURRENT_USER_ID)
	.then(currentUser => { /* ... */ })
	.catch(error => { /* handle any errors */ });

// Update the name for folder with ID 123
client.folders.update('123', { name: 'New Folder Name' })
	.then(folderInfo => { /* ... */ })
	.catch(error => { /* handle any errors */ });

// Upload a new file to folder 123
client.files.uploadFile('123', 'bicycle.png', fileContents)
	.then(fileObject => { /* ... */ })
	.catch(error => { /* handle any errors */ });

// Delete the comment with ID 456
client.comments.delete('456')
	.then(() => { /* ... */ })
	.catch(error => { /* handle any errors */ });
```

For complete documentation about the available operations, please see
the [SDK documentation pages](./docs) and the auto-generated
[JSDocs](https://rawgit.com/box/box-node-sdk/main/docs/jsdoc/index.html).
These contain detailed information about which methods are available and
how to use them.

### Constructing API Calls Manually

The SDK also exposes low-level request methods for constructing your own API calls.
These can be useful for adding your own API calls that aren't yet explicitly supported by the SDK.

The low-level methods always return a response object that contains the raw API response, and do not
turn non-2xx status codes into errors like the normal client methods do.

```js
// GET /files/123?fields=id,name
client.get('/files/123', {qs: {fields: 'id,name'}})
	.then(response => { /* ... */ })
	.catch(error => { /* handle any errors */ });

// PUT /files/123
// {
//     "name": "New File Name"
// }
client.put('/files/123', {body: {name: 'New File Name'}});
	.then(response => { /* ... */ })
	.catch(error => { /* handle any errors */ });

// DELETE /files/123
client.del('/files/123');
	.then(response => { /* ... */ })
	.catch(error => { /* handle any errors */ });
```

## Versions
We use a modified version of [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) for all changes. See [version strategy](VERSIONS.md) for details which is effective from 30 July 2022.

### Supported Version

Only the current MAJOR version of SDK is supported. New features, functionality, bug fixes, and security updates will only be added to the current MAJOR version.

A current release is on the leading edge of our SDK development, and is intended for customers who are in active development and want the latest and greatest features.  
Instead of stating a release date for a new feature, we set a fixed minor or patch release cadence of maximum 2-3 months (while we may release more often). 
At the same time, there is no schedule for major or breaking release. Instead, we will communicate one quarter in advance the upcoming breaking change to 
allow customers to plan for the upgrade. We always recommend that all users run the latest available minor release for whatever major version is in use. 
We highly recommend upgrading to the latest SDK major release at the earliest convenient time and before the EOL date.
