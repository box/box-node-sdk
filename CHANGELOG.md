* Added support for [file collaborations](./docs/collaborations.md#add-a-collaboration).
Users can now invite others to collaborate on single files.
See [the blog post](https://blog.box.com/blog/file-collaboration-api/) for more information.
* Fixed an issue where users were unable to use JWT Server Auth when their computers' clocks
were not synchronized with the Box API servers.
* All asynchronous client methods now return Promises in addition to taking a
(now-optional) callback parameter, so you can write more modern JS with the SDK.
* The SDK can now be preconfigured using a JSON blob that can be downloaded in the
Box Dev Console for JWT Server Authentication apps, making it easier to get started
developing!
* Added support for [chunked upload](./docs/files.md#chunked-upload), where a large
file can be uploaded one piece at a time.  This makes large file uploads much faster
and more reliable, since parts can be uploaded in parallel and failed parts can be
retried in isolation.

admins to auto-confirm the alias.
* Added support for the [Enterprise Events stream](./docs/events.md#enterprise-events).
* Added an option to have collections methods (e.g. `folders.getItems()`,
`enterprise.getUsers()`, etc) return [async iterators](./README.md#iterators) that will automatically
page through the collection.  This conforms to the [proposed async iteration spec](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-async-iteration),
which will eventually allow them to be used in ergonomic for-await-of loop syntax.
